# Code for publication entitled "Enhancing ICD-Code-Based Case Definition for Heart Failure Using Electronic Medical Record Data"

*Currently accepted at [Journal of Cardiac Failure](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-cardiac-failure)*


The data to run the code contain sensitive health information, and therefore haven't been included in the repository. Additionally, we thought the XGBoost models generated may contain too much information so also haven't been included. The Decision Tree models have been included however.
